I just wanted to get in touch to see if we could discuss further your interest in a story on our work on Chappie, and possibly beyond. \n\n \n\nI have a lot to say about the creative process on Chappie, but as you might already know, at SkyLab we also have created a unique post-production approach to complex, VFX-heavy films. The two aspects really go hand in hand.\n\n \n\nThe workflows we developed on Elysium and Chappie were customized to weave VFX, dailies, editorial and creative color grading seamlessly together on parallel tracks, throughout the finishing process. We have found that this process not only saved time and money to the productions, but actually opened up more creative control for the entire team. \n\n \n\nWe are excited to share these stories so that we can continue to build behind-the-scenes processes that will enable more time and space for directors, producers and cinematographers to engage creatively in post production.\n\n \n\nSince Sam Trounce is away for the next couple of weeks, I will be your main point of contact here at SkyLab. Let me know if you have any time to talk in the coming weeks.\n\n \n\nBest,\n\nAndrea\n\n ",""
